How do I find a solution to the given problem? How can I be sure that it’s a good solution and it actually does what we expect it to do ?</p>\n<p>Also, just like we want the essay to be splendid, our ultimate goal is to provide clean, robust, consistent solution. Easier said than done I hear, but it is our goal anyway!</p>\n<h2>💭 Before coding</h2>\n<p>There are few questions I ask myself before writting any code. What is the input? What is the action to perform? What will be the output or observable changes in my system?<br>\nDoes it make you think of something? Well, I guess writing a test can help as those are exactly its three composites. I initially did not want to use the term ‘testing’ but you’ve guessed it so I won’t beat around the bush.</p>\n<p>In this post I am going to talk about TDD—Test Driven Development—as it’s one of the way I often use to approch a task, problem.</p>\n<h2>🚦 Red-Green factor</h2>\n<p>First let me quote the three rules of TDD defined by Uncle Bob:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those rules may look a bit <em>strict</em> and following them may not be natural at first. But let me tell you: <strong>it’s a discipline!</strong></p>\n<p>I really understood it the day I was pair-programming with my mate. There was that new feature, not very complex, we decided to implement in TDD. It included calculating a median.</p>\n<p><em>We first need sort the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">n</span></span></span></span> items, if I have an odd number of items then we take the middle one otherwise we take the mean of the two middle values. Easy peasy!</em> I thought.</p>\n<p>The <em>algorithm</em> in mind and the keyboard on hand, I was ready to code.\nI jumped right into the implementation but my friend stopped me: “wait… what are you doing? Delete that code you just wrote”. Indeed, we hadn’t written any red test yet and… we had an agreement, doing it in TDD. And each time I wanted to code the whole feature in one go, without having the goal of making a red test become green, my friend was there to remind me not to do so and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The red-green factor is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>❌ Write a failing test </li>\n<li>✅ Make that test pass </li>\n<li>🧹  Make it clean, refactor your code while keeping the tests green </li>\n</ul>\n<p>↺ Repeat!</p>\n<p>It was a bit hard because  But every time we made the failing test pass is was such a satisfaction, you can’t imagine! So rewarding!!\nIt also has many benefits that I’ll talk about in this post.</p>\n<p>Also that task was really not that difficult and wouldn’t even requires any tests in the first place… but that’s the trap we should not fall in… technical debt comes like that.</p>\n<p>discover that maybe we’ve not all the solution in mind\nmaybe we did not have the whole solution in mind, we discover new needs.</p>\n<p>incrementally derives solution to a problem</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"One way to approach a problem","date":"January 31, 2019","spoiler":"Gonna talk about tdd","thumbnail":null},"fields":{"slug":"/tdd/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tdd/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/git-rebase/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rewrite the past in fewer steps with rebase","draft":null}},"next":null}}
